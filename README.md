# PhraseExpressUtils
My PhraseExpress development utilities library. 

[PhraseExpress](http://www.phraseexpress.com/) is a text expander tool which can be used to automate just about anything in a windows environment. I previously used [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) for automation utlities but have moved to PhraseExpress due to how easy it is to use and create new automated utilites. 

I still use autohotkey for a few things that cannot be done in PhraseExpress. The AutoHotKey scripts which I use can be seen in my other [repository](https://github.com/markquinn12/autoHotKey)

####Pre-requisites
Install [PhraseExpress](http://www.phraseexpress.com/download.php)!

##Usage
Import the [Marks Phrases.pxp](Marks Phrases.pxp). Have a look through the phrases which I haved created.

Phrase express is a very individual utility. Every person will want to use it differently. Hopefully my exported phrases will give you some ideas for your own automated utilities.

Enjoy!
